## What

 - We were tasked with creating a stopwatch using TDD methodology

**User Stories**

We are creating the stopwatch for a software developer who wants to accurately predict how long a coding task takes to complete. The developer needs the following:

- [ ] I can press a start button, in order to start a timer
- [ ] I can press a stop button, in order to stop the timer at how much time has passed since start
- [ ] I can press a reset button, in order to stop the timer and reset the displayed time to 00:00:00:00
- [ ] I can see the timer's current time in hours, seconds, minutes and milliseconds

**Stretch Goals**

- [ ] Use BlanketJS for code coverage
- [ ] Countdown Timer
- [ ] Pomodoro Timer (to time out breaks)
- [ ] Add alarm sound when timer finishes
- [ ] Add prompt if user exits webpage while timer running
- [ ] CSS bomb animation
- [ ] Add realtime on watch face
- [ ] Buttons disappear when timer started
- [ ] Countdown till special dates in the year e.g. Christmas

## How

1. Set up documents and test files
2. 1.5 hour technical spike
3. Create issues for individually assigned tasks
4. Use TDD methodology and ping pong (i.e write tests before writing code)

## Interesting Stuff We have Learnt

 **Asynchronous Testing**

 When testing asynchronous features such as setTimeout() and setInterval(), you need to use asynchronous testing
